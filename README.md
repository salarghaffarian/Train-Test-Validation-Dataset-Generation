# Repository Name >> Train-Test-Validation-Dataset-Generation

## App Name >> Patchify

#### Description >> This app is designed for crop images and creating small patches of a large image e.g. Satellite/Aerial Images, which will then be used for training and testing Deep Learning models specifically **semantic segmentation** models.


Functionalities: Patchify is capable of:

 - Crop the large image into small patches based on the user-defined patch window-size and patch stride/step independently in two x and y directions.
 - Augmenting the cropped dataset to expand the size of the training dataset and make the model to improve the model performance with better generalizing for unseen samples.
 - Dividing the created dataset into different Train, Test, and Validation dataset with user defined percentages.
